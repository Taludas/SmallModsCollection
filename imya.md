# Small Mods Collection for Anno 1800

This is a collection of my small mods for Anno 1800, bringing fixes, UI changes and QoL Updates to the game.

***These Mods are savegame-compatible. Save to install/uninstall mid playthrough.*** 

## Mod Description with main feature overview
**Please remember to always check the Changelog to see the new or changed features.**

### More Arctic Scrap

This little mod makes scrap grinding in the Arctic more easy. It increases the maxium scrap amount from a crate to 15. Average is going up as well, the range is normally between 5 and 15 tons per crate.

Note that the "new" crates need some time to spawn, so don't worry if your first crates have normal amounts of scrap in them.

### Campher and Cinnamon Orchards use different tree configs

This mod fixes not only the oversight, that camphor and cinnamon orchards use the same tree as graphic asset, but the same tree config as well. So before cinnamon and camphor orchards haven't had their productivity lowered by overlap as much as the other orchards. To fix this, I created a recoloured tree prop with the camphor tree as base. The new tree is a little smaller, the leaves use a darker green colour and the bark is now coloured in a more redish tone. With the tree ready I assigned it to a unused tree config of the NW, so that now cinnamon and camphor orchard overlap properly. The cinnamon tree can be used for the tree brush as well.

In addition, the orchards are now located in a separate construction category inside the Jornalero build menu to reduce the entries for better overall visibility.
Furthermore, I reduced the internal storage of all orchards from 10 to 4 to reduce the enormous range they have in vanilla which creates all sorts of logistical problems.

~~This small mod fixes the notorious bug with the floating plains of celluloid in the chemical factory for celluloid which Ubi continues to ignore or just won't fix, so I did it myself.~~ NO LONGER NECESSARY SINCE GU16 FIXED THIS!

## Adjustments for HighLife Goods

This mod is not really made by request, but by an idea from Wiesel in the Ubisoft Discussion Forum. His post in the Ubi-Forum inspired me to adjust some of the highlife goods and features for better integration with tourist season and other DLC.

### ~~Fertiliser Silo in Enbesa costs Wanza and Mudbricks~~

~~This small mod changes the building costs of the Fertiliser Silos in Enbesa from Timber and Bricks to use Wanza Wood and Mudbricks.~~ NO LONGER NECESSARY SINCE GU15 FIXED THIS!

Adds the Particularly Pull-y Pulley to be craftable at Old N8s Kontor in the Arctic Region.
It comes at quite a hefty cost though! So be prepared!

The crafting recipe is unlocked upon completing the main storyline of the arctic session (so when you get your first pulley).

### No anarchistic Mercier Building Decorations

Just a little mod to get rid off the ugly anarchistic Mercier flags that pop up all over your residences and factories if they are influenced by a anarchistic Mercier Item like the Sophisms, Pietro Proud or the Printing Press so that you can enjoy an unobstructed view onto your city.

### Remove Ketemas Comments

Tired of Emperor Ketema commenting on all things you do? Increasing hours for your workers, building water pumps, researching great discoveries, your city going up in flames? No more, I virtually shut his mouth so that you can be a cruel multi-million industrial and exploit the workforce of your people properly.

### Alternative Mercier Loudspeakers
![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64583643/170460843-5c8c864d-399d-4ce3-9ec5-5070ab1a02e1.png)

Adds three new variations of the Anarchist Loudspeaker Ornament.

Cycle through the variations of the original Loudspeaker ornament with your individual hotkey (Standard: Shift+V) to get to the new variations.

Needs the Uplay reward unlocked to be able to build the loudspeaker ornament.

### Drugstore and Furniture Store Icon Colour Swap
![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64583643/170460854-c50aa254-46d1-43f0-ad12-301d92f81f21.png)

Ever wondered why the icon background colour of the shopping arcades doesn't fit the roof colour of the respective building? Look no further. This small mod changes the background colour of the icons of the furniture store and the drugstore to the colour of the roofs of their buildings for better accessability and congruence.

Second feature is the coulour change of the 6 flags hanging on the long side of the buildings to true player colour. Before they were mixed up because there was an other colour underneath the player colour layer.

### Fancy Billardtable Icon
![banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64583643/170460874-a68b7f1a-4a88-4e67-ae48-dc040e95c06d.png)

You enjoy it thinking about Investors having to hump up a new billard table to their appartement in the skyscraper every day? Then this mod is just for you. Replaces the Icon for Billard Tables with on more suited for a sturdy and heavy Billard Table.

In my opinion, the Billard Table Icon from the Highlife DLC is a little underwhelming. If you have played at a tournament graded table once, you will see that these legs are to small and not sturdy enough to be a good quality billard table. Since there is an alternative Icon file in the game assets, which looks way better in my opinion, I wrote this little mod to just replace the icon. Nothing else was changed gamplay wise!

### Mine Slot Unification
![Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64583643/192851935-eda188f4-2cd9-41a8-976a-3445e1ba52f4.png)

This little mod allows you to build every mine on any slot available. There is one uniform slot for all mines. Therefore you can no longer build mines directly from clicking on the slot. You have to find the mine in the build menu first! 

Same goes for clay pits. There is now one slot called Opencast Ressource Deposit on which all opencast mines will fit.

After DLC12, I exchanged all new mine slots in the New World (Bauxite, Helium, Iron, Minerals) with Gold slots. If you use an existing savegame, the way I implemented it means, that on Manola, the slots are uniform in Icons and slot type, but if you click on, it doesn't highlight all mines. But I don't think this is a big issue, since all mines are suited for all slots. If you start a new game, this issue is not present.

**WARNING:** The activation of this mod in a savegame means, that this savegame now relays on the presence of the mod. If you remove mid playthrough, all mine slots will become iron or gold depending on the region and all opencast ressource mines become clay slots. The mines may no longer fit the slot, so you cannot build them any longer. So watch out! If you want to remove the mod, load a savegame from before loading this mod for the first time! Make a save before with a clear name so you can always remember it!

### Combined Customizable Research and Items Mod
![banner](https://github.com/Taludas/SmallModsCollection/assets/64583643/42e6eaa8-6c8b-4e3b-914a-8b1a3999ad66)

This mod is combining one of the most anticipated QoL Updates since the release of Anno 1800 concerning Item gameplay - at least for me - with a fully customizable Research Institute. This mod is meant to be tweaked via iModYourAnno Mod Manager. Otherwise you'll get vanilla values for all the features concerning the Research Institute.

- You can now stack every item in the game apart from Quest Items (which are usually unique) to 99 pieces a stack. No longer maintaining a whole fleet to buy a hand full of items from Eli. This should be a huge time saver in long term. Just buy one of each item you want to mass-purchase, then afterwards all other items will be greyed out because of no space left inside your ship. Only the selected items will be buyable and stack inside your ship. 
- You can modify nearly every value involved with the Research Institute. From maximium Queue Size, over custom research time and cost config, cost limit for item research, till number of permits granted per research. Best have a look inside iMYA and play around with the numbers to get the full experience.
- You can also customize the Item Transfer Module in every session. Frustrated over the limit of 24 items? No problem, with this mod you can increase it to whatever number you like. You can get rid of the timer until the item is available, too! Includes support for Arctis and Enbesa Modules, if you use those mods.

### Fan Factory Fixed
![banner](https://github.com/Taludas/SmallModsCollection/assets/64583643/4d7e70c2-4b2b-4f88-b3d6-01eda93bc414)

This mod is fixing the issue present since GU17 concerning the Ventilator/Fan Factory. The building is sporting a 0.5 tile offset, that made it impossible to be clipped, since the center of the building was off-grid and disrupted the usual clipping mechanic.

If you install this mod and have already built some Fan Factories in your savegame, you will have some graphical issues where street might clip through the building. This can be easily solved by grabbing the building up with the Move-Tool. When placing the building down again, the graphical issue is fixed.

### Combined Influence Mod for Residences
![banner](https://github.com/Taludas/SmallModsCollection/assets/64583643/12eebe09-b303-4b3d-8f49-4d31a00fe3df)

This mod allows for customized Amounts of Influence gained from residences in all sessions. The tweaking can be done via iMYA or by manual asset modification. Standard Values are vanilla. You can also customize the amount of Influence gained for Engineers from the Palace Edict and the amount gained for Obreros/Artistas from the Hacienda Decree. Notice that the values are absolute and won't get influenced by the game setting concerning the amount of Influence gained by residences!

### No Explosions
![banner](https://github.com/Taludas/SmallModsCollection/assets/64583643/f021808c-0ba2-48db-be8b-0d00d7792554)

A very simple mod that adds a buff to all buildings with a maintenance cost (GUID=368) that reduces the chance of an explosion by 1000%. So even if you have other buffs or items active in your factory that increase the risk of an explosion, it is very unlikely that it will ever happen again. This mod reduces the annoyance of going through all the sessions to restore the ruins. Have fun and above all, safe building!
