            <Text>Once upon a time, one of the local priests decided to enter the catacombs beneath this old church. He didn't return from the journey. Ever since, the church's backyard transformed more and more into a spooky, misty graveyard, and some people swear, they saw gravestones and crupts popping up out of nowhere. Nevertheless, some strange cultists have began praying in the church and stenches of blood could be seen at the doorstep. Better to not mess with those folks!</Text>
